“There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.”
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."

GC:
A woman can be overdressed but never over elegant. 
"Some people think luxury is the opposite of poverty. It is not. It is the opposite of vulgarity."
“Fashion fades. Only style remains the same.”
“Elegance is when the inside is as beautiful as the outside.”
“The best things in life are free. The second best are very, very expensive.”
“In order to be irreplaceable one must always be different.”
“Don’t spend time beating on a wall, hoping to transform it into a door.”
The most courageous act is still to think for yourself. Aloud. 
Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they remember the woman.
